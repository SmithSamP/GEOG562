Added parametric equation for elipse
Made elipse variable with sliders using matplotlib package

Next step is to find u as a function of h. Problem is that I don't understand the integration of the derivitive du/dh, as the upper limit seems to be referencing itself, with u(h).

Modeled equation is on desmos at https://www.desmos.com/calculator/rhdsg1tzea
*Note, desmos only accepts t as an angle in a parametric equation, so I substituted t for u
